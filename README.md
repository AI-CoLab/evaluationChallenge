2. If you work for government, check which AI tools your agency allows. You may also create everything on a personal device—no sensitive data is involved.  
3. Re-imagine the report findings for **your chosen audience** (e.g. executive decision makers, policy officers, community groups, students).

*Anything goes*: infographics, dashboards, explainers, song lyrics, TikTok scripts, interactive notebooks, narrated slide decks, short films, chatbot prototypes…
